Stretch Requirements

    🏹 Create dynamic pages using react-router. ✅
    🏹 Use react-router to create a dedicated route for the categories ✅
        For example, /posts/:categoryName. ✅
    🏹 Allow users to delete posts. ✅
    🏹 Add ‘like’ functionality on posts. ✅
    🏹 Create additional SQL queries to show filtered posts. ❌


I do not have multiple different filters with SQL queries as I did not see a use case for them without forcing a feature in.
Logon is simple and not secure but is used to verify users liking and deleting their own posts and being able to view user profiles by clicking on their name.
